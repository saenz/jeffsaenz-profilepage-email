This repo is based on the work that was done for the serverless.com example [Serverless Form Mail](https://github.com/takahashim/sls-form-mail). Made some minor tweaks to add CORS headers support but otherwise it worked well.

I'm using this as the backend function to send email from my contact form on my profile page. It uses serverless framework, AWS lambda and AWS SNS.
